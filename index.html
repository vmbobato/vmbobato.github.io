            <p class="flex-1">Hi, I'm Vinicius Bobato! I'm a PhD student in Computer Engineering at Texas A&M University, and I've always been passionate about
                 exploring how technology can make a real difference in the world. My interests range from diving into cybersecurity and network analysis to building 
                 embedded systems and, more recently, learning about AI and machine learning. I've had the chance to work on some exciting projects, from automating 
                 tasks with embedded systems to tackling challenges in network security. When I'm not researching or building something new, I enjoy teaching, mentoring,
                  and staying curious about the latest advancements in tech. I'm always looking for ways to grow and take on meaningful challenges!

        <p class="mt-2">Current Projects:</p>
        <ul class="mt-2 list-disc pl-5">
            <li><strong>European Land Mass</strong> - I want to train a neural network using satellite 
                images from Kaggle to classify land types such as city areas, forests, farmland, mountains, 
                and roads. This classification can be used to automate land measurement calculations, which 
                could be used in urban planning, agriculture planning, and environmental monitoring (for example 
                monitor amount of melted ice per year or deforesting).</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mt-2">Here are some projects I have worked on:</p>
        <ul class="mt-2 list-disc pl-5">
            <li><strong>Engineering Capstone (Academic)</strong> - As a project manager I led the development of a laboratory bench with switches, routers, and firewalls to simulate a 
                Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system in energy utility companies. The lab bench included a custom Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) built with a Raspberry Pi
                 that connected analog and digital sensors and actuators. The data from the sensors and  the status of actuators are sent to a Graphical User Interface (GUI), where 
                 the data is displayed. The project used an industrial control system (ICS) protocol called Distributed Network Protocol 3 (DNP3) to establish network connection between
                  the HMI and RTU to send commands and collect measurements. The project used Python 3.9 for the embedded code and the MCP3008 10-bit ADC with an SPI interface. The DNP3 protocol was implemented 
                with the <a href="https://github.com/dnp3/opendnp3" class="text-maroon-600" style="color: #500000">OpenDNP3 C++ library</a>.</li>
            <li><strong>Machine Learning Based Firewall (Acdemic)</strong> - </li>
            <li><strong>ShellBridge (Personal)</strong> - Developed a reverse shell application, enabling remote server interaction. Facilitated secure file transfers with download and upload functionalities 
                using SSL/TLS, demonstrating skills in networking and cybersecurity. This project was created to facilitate the file transfer between virtual machines.</li>
            <li><strong>Personal Password Manager (Personal)</strong> - Developed a personalized password manager leveraging Python programming. Implemented algorithms to generate robust passwords, while efficiently 
                storing them in a secure MySQL database using a MySQL Python API, underscoring skills in encryption, data protection, and database management.</li>
